This learning project is based of of two example projects from Okta Developer.
* [angular-7-spring-boot-2.1](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/08/22/basic-crud-angular-7-and-spring-boot-2)
* [angular-8-spring-boot-2.2](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/05/13/angular-8-spring-boot-2)

```$xslt
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run:
